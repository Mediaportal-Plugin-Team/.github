# Mediaportal Plugin Team

A repository that contains Plugins and Skins for Mediaportal from different authors who, for some reason, stopped updating their plugins.

## Development

All plugins in this repository are automatically compiled with each change, the result of the compilation is available in artifacts, just like the MPE1 installation package.

When the package configuration file (XMP2) is changed, the Plugin release is automatically compiled and published.
